SYNOPSIS

Math::Combination_out - Combinations without or with repetition

In this module was applied the approach for k-combinations without and with repetition in lexicographic order, 
presented in the ANSI-C code by Siegfried Koepf at:

=head1 SYNOPSIS

EXAMPLE:

use Math::Combination_out;

{my @words = qw/a1 b2 c3 d4 e5 f6/; #array for combinatorics
my $k = 4; #length for combinatorics, use only integer!
my $opt = 1; #option: 1 - without repetition

push(@words, $k, $opt);

print Combinations(@words),"\n"}

{my @words = qw/a1 b2 c3/; #array for combinatorics

my $k = 3; #length for combinatorics, use only integer!
my $opt = 2; #option: 2 - with repetition

push(@words, $k, $opt);

print Combinations(@words),"\n";}

Result:

(Combinations without repetition):

(1) a1 b2 c3 d4
(2) a1 b2 c3 e5
