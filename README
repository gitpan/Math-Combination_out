SYNOPSIS

Math::Combination_out - Prints combinations without or with repetition

In this module was applied the approach for k-combinations without and with repetition in lexicographic order, 
presented in the ANSI-C code by Siegfried Koepf at:

http://www.aconnect.de/friends/editions/computer/combinatoricode_e.html

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Example1: Combinations without repetition

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use diagnostics;

use Math::Combination_out qw(:CMB);

BEGIN {
  use lib 'lib';
}

#array for combinatorics
my @words = qw/a1 b2 c3 d4 e5 f6/;

#length for combinatorics, use only integer!
my $k = 4;

#option: 1 - without repetition
my $opt = 1;

push(@words, $k);
push(@words, $opt);

print Combinations(@words),"\n";

Result:

(1) a1 b2 c3 d4
(2) a1 b2 c3 e5
(3) a1 b2 c3 f6
(4) a1 b2 d4 e5
(5) a1 b2 d4 f6
(6) a1 b2 e5 f6
(7) a1 c3 d4 e5
(8) a1 c3 d4 f6
(9) a1 c3 e5 f6
(10) a1 d4 e5 f6
(11) b2 c3 d4 e5
(12) b2 c3 d4 f6
(13) b2 c3 e5 f6
(14) b2 d4 e5 f6
(15) c3 d4 e5 f6

Example2: Combinations with repetition

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use diagnostics;

use Math::Combination_out qw(:CMB);

BEGIN {
  use lib 'lib';
}

#array for combinatorics
my @words = qw/a1 b2 c3/;

#length for combinatorics, use only integer!
my $k = 3;

#option: 2 - with repetition
my $opt = 2;

push(@words, $k);
push(@words, $opt);

print Combinations(@words),"\n";

Result:

(1) a1 a1 a1
(2) a1 a1 b2
(3) a1 a1 c3
(4) a1 b2 b2
(5) a1 b2 c3
(6) a1 c3 c3
(7) b2 b2 b2
(8) b2 b2 c3
(9) b2 c3 c3
(10) c3 c3 c3
